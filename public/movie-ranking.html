<h3>Clue</h3>
<p>I love that when this movie debuted there were alternate endings. You would have to see the movie multiple times to see
    all of the endings.

<h3>What Dreams May Come</h3>
<p>The cinematogrophy in this film is incredible</p>

<h3>Jurassic Park</h3>
<p>Shockingly, I only recently saw this movie for the first time. This 30 year old film still amazed. I was surprised
    that I jumped out of my seat. I think the true mark of an incredible film is that even when someone watches it 30 
    years later they still have the director's intended reaction.
